# digitRecognition
Image processing and  machine leaning using python and opencv to find digits and its location in an image.

Made as part assignment of e-Yantra robotics competition.
This Python code is used to recognize a number and its location in matrix. It uses openCV(v3.3) and numpy as dependencies. 
KNearest neighbour algorithm is used as machine learning tool to predict the digits. To find the cells, two seperate methods have been implemented in the given two files.
